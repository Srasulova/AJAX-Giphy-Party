#Gif search project

## It allows the user to search for a GIF.
## When the form is submitted, it makes an AJAX request to the Giphy API and returns a single GIF.
## Once the Giphy API has responded with data, it appends the GIF to the page.
## It allows the user to remove all of the GIFs by clicking a button. 

### Currently, it doesn't validate the absense of user input and doesn't give an error message
